The primary objective is to address the critical challenge of precise age prediction based on a multitude of health indicators, with potential applications spanning healthcare, epidemiology, and public health research.
The significance of predicting age extends beyond a mere demographic exercise. Accurate age prediction models can have implications in the fields of personalized medicine, where age serves as a crucial factor in understanding health risks and treatment responses. 
Additionally, such models can aid in the assessment of public health programs and the allocation of resources based on age-specific health needs.
